# WSLTux

This is a Windows 10/11 system tray app to monitor and control your Windows Subsystem for Linux distributions. It gives a visual indication that a WSL distribution is active (or that none are active).

Usage:
- run the app, click on a distribution you want to run, and click Start
- close the app with the X in the corner, or click on cancel, and the app will stay running in the background
- the system tray icon of Tux will be in color if at least one distribution is running, otherwise Tux will be faded and grayed out
- click on Tux in the system tray to bring back the main dialog window
- right click on the Tux icon and click Exit to terminate the application
